Predicting tumor malignancy using logistic regression on Breast Cancer dataset

# Breast Cancer Prediction using Machine Learning
📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on building a machine learning model to predict whether a tumor is malignant or benign using the Breast Cancer Wisconsin Diagnostic Dataset obtained from Kaggle. Two classification algorithms were implemented and compared:

✅ Logistic Regression

✅ Random Forest Classifier

🎯 Objectives
Understand and apply basic classification algorithms

Perform data preprocessing and feature selection

Train and test models on real-world healthcare data

Compare model performance

🗂️ Dataset
📍 Source: Kaggle - Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Data Set

💡 Features: radius, texture, perimeter, area, smoothness, and more

🎯 Target: Diagnosis (M = Malignant, B = Benign)

🛠️ Tools & Technologies:

Python

Jupyter Notebook

Libraries: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, scikit-learn

📊 Workflow

Load and explore the Kaggle dataset

Preprocess the data

Drop unnecessary columns

Encode categorical variables

Split data into train and test sets


Train models using:

Logistic Regression

Random Forest Classifier

Evaluate the model accuracy using basic metrics


✅ Results
Both models achieved ~92% accuracy

Model Performance

🔹 Logistic Regression

✅ Training Accuracy: 94.72%

✅ Testing Accuracy: 92.10%

🔹 Random Forest Classifier

✅ Training Accuracy: 100%

✅ Testing Accuracy: 92.10%

Random Forest and Logistic Regression showed similar performance on the test data

🚀 Future Scope:

Add confusion matrix, ROC-AUC curves for better insights

Perform hyperparameter tuning

Deploy as a web application using Flask or Streamlit
